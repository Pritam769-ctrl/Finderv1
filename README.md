# 📱 Finder App - User Manual

**Finder** is your personal, offline digital organizer. It helps you remember where you put things by storing photos, videos, locations, and notes directly on your device.

This guide covers every feature of the app to help you get the most out of it.

### 💾 Storage

* **Restore:** Puts the item back on your home screen.

### ☁️ Data Management (Backup & Restore)

1.  **Backup (Download):** Creates a file (`.json`) containing all your photos, videos, and notes. Save this file to your phone or Google Drive.
2.  **Restore (Merge):** Tap this to select a backup file you previously saved. It will add those items to your current app.

### ⚠️ Reset App
* This button wipes **everything**. All photos, notes, and settings will be deleted. Use this only if you want a fresh start.
